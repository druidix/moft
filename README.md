My Own Flight Tracker.  Combining my beloved hobby with coding!

I was looking for a pet project to pick up coding again after way too many years.  Since I now am a licensed General Aviation private pilot, I figured I'd write a flight tracker.

Currently displays flights given a default bounding box with option to reset the box parameters.

Coming soon:
-  Lookup using specific tail number / ICAO24
